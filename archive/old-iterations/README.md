# Archive: Old Iterations

This folder contains files from earlier development iterations before the systematic sector testing approach.

## Contents

### Planning Documents
- **plan.md** - Original project plan
- **RENAME_PLAN.md** - Early file renaming strategy
- **ITERATION_4_PLAN.md** - Fourth iteration planning

### Historical Analysis
- **LESSONS_LEARNED.md** - Insights from testing all 40 strategies on SPY

### Scripts
- **rename_scripts.ps1** - PowerShell script for batch file renaming

### Early Work Folders
- **Claude/** - Early pine script experiments (alt1-5)
- **LLM-inputs/** - Reference materials from different AI systems
- **backtest-screenshots/** - Original SPY backtest screenshots (all 40 strategies)

## Why Archived

These files represent the discovery phase where:
1. We tested all 40 strategies on SPY
2. Found that alt31 worked great on SPY but failed on other tickers
3. Realized strategy performance is asset-specific

This led to the current systematic sector testing approach documented in the root directory.

## Current Approach (Root Directory)

The project has evolved into a systematic sector testing methodology:
- 10 carefully selected strategies (diverse approaches, not just SPY winners)
- 11 sector categories
- Clean organization by sector
- Focus on learning "what works WHERE" rather than "what works on SPY"
