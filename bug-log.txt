SINGLE BUG CONFIRMED:
- sectors/etfs-SPY/screenshots/alt39 adaptive targets profitable_micro.png

RECOMMENDATION:
Invalidate SPY Alt39 results from cleaned-data.csv
All other 387 strategy/asset combinations are VALID

Root cause: Alt39 exit logic stopped executing around 2017 on SPY specifically,
causing the strategy to become buy-and-hold instead of actively managing exits.
This bug is isolated to SPY + Alt39 combination only.
