## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Mistake 1: Trying to use all screeners at once
**Instead:** Pick ONE workflow (A, B, or C) and stick to it for a month

### ❌ Mistake 2: Trading when screeners return zero
**Instead:** Zero results = correct answer (no good setups today)

### ❌ Mistake 3: Ignoring the Market Temperature check
**Instead:** Always start with C1 screener (are ETFs trending?)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Trading utilities/energy "just once"
**Instead:** Your data shows 0% success rate. Never trade DUK, XLU, XLE.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not using TradingView for final validation
**Instead:** Screeners find candidates, TradingView + scripts find entries

---

## 💬 QUICK FAQ

**Q: Which workflow should I start with?**
**A:** If you have 15 min/week → Full System (Option A)  
If you have 5 min/week → Time-Efficient (Option B)  
If you want safest → Conservative (Option C)

**Q: What if all screeners return zero?**
**A:** That's the correct answer. Bear market = no trades. Sit in cash.

**Q: Can I trade stocks not in healthcare/tech?**
**A:** Yes, but success rate drops. Your data: Healthcare 92%, Tech 71%, Others < 65%.

**Q: Do I need FINVIZ Pro?**
**A:** No. Free version works fine. Pro adds real-time data + more filters.

**Q: Which Pine Script should I use?**
**A:** Start with Alt43 (works on everything). Add Alt46 (healthcare specialist) and Alt15 (MSFT specialist) later.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
**A:** Track your trades. You should see 60-75% win rate in first month, approaching 70-90% by month 3.

**Your edge:**
- 293 backtests proving what works
- 92% success rate in healthcare
