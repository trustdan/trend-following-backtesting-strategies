## 🎯 PRIORITIZATION CHEAT SHEET

When you have 50+ results, narrow by this order:

**1. Sector (most important)**
- ✅ Healthcare (92% success)
- ✅ Technology (71% success)
- ⚠️ Consumer Discretionary (64% success)
- ⚠️ Industrials (57% success)
- ❌ Utilities (0% success)
- ❌ Energy (21% success)

**2. Your backtest data**
- ✅ Tested + Profitable? → PRIORITY
- ⚠️ Tested + Break-even? → Maybe
- ❌ Tested + Unprofitable? → NEVER
- ⚠️ Never tested? → Research first

**3. Chart pattern**
- ✅ Clean uptrend (like XLV 2010-2025)
- ⚠️ Choppy but trending (like GOOGL)
- ❌ Sideways/range-bound (like DUK)

**4. Options liquidity**
- ✅ Weekly options + OI > 100
- ⚠️ Monthly only + OI > 50
- ❌ Illiquid (spread > $1)

## 📊 FINVIZ SORTING TIPS

After running screener, sort by these columns:

**For New Ideas:**
- Sort by "Market Cap" → See mega-caps first
- Sort by "Perf Year" → See best performers
- Sort by "Volume" → See most liquid

**For Quick Decisions:**
- Sort by "Sector" → Group Healthcare/Tech together
- Sort by "Change" → See what's hot TODAY
- Sort by "Rel Volume" → Unusual activity

**Don't sort by:**
- "Beta" → Meaningless without context
- "P/E" → Doesn't matter for trend-following
- "RSI" → Too noisy for screening

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FILTERS (NEVER SKIP)

These 4 filters appear in ALL working screeners:

1. **Market Cap: +Mid or +Large**
   - Why: Ensures liquid options
   - Avoid: Small caps (<$2B) = illiquid hell

2. **Price: Above SMA200**
   - Why: Trend confirmation (YOUR #1 success factor)
   - Avoid: Below SMA200 = fighting the trend

3. **Average Volume: >500K**
   - Why: Tradable options, tight spreads
   - Avoid: <500K = wide bid-ask spreads

4. **Sector: Healthcare or Technology**
   - Why: 92% and 71% success rates
   - Avoid: Utilities (0%), Energy (21%)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Tip #1: Start with ETFs**
If overwhelmed by 50+ stock results:
- Just trade XLV (healthcare) or QQQ (tech)
- Your Alt43 on XLV = +34.79%
- Simplest execution, proven results

**Tip #2: Refresh weekly, not daily**
- Monday morning: Run all screeners
- Rest of week: Work your list
- Don't chase new names mid-week

**Tip #3: Manual > Algorithmic**
- FINVIZ finds candidates
- YOU pick winners (using your 293 backtests)
- Trust your data > trust the screener

**Tip #4: Quality > Quantity**
- Better to deeply analyze 10 stocks
- Than superficially scan 100 stocks

**Tip #5: Build your watch list**
- Keep a "permanent watch list" of your best 20
- Run screener #3 (Proven Winners) daily
- Only trade those when above SMA200

---

## 🔄 WHEN SCREENERS RETURN ZERO RESULTS

If you get 0-5 results, you're over-filtering. Fix it:

**Remove these filters FIRST:**
- ❌ RSI range (too restrictive)
- ❌ Beta range (not critical)
- ❌ EPS growth requirements (trend > fundamentals)
- ❌ SMA20 > SMA50 (nice-to-have, not must-have)

**Keep these filters ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Sector (Healthcare/Tech)
- ✅ Price > SMA200 (trend confirmation)
- ✅ Volume > 500K (liquidity)
- ✅ Market cap > $2B (options trading)

---

## 📅 MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

**Daily (5 minutes):**
- Check #4 (Sector ETF Rotation)
- Are XLV, QQQ still above SMA200?

**Weekly (15 minutes):**
- Monday: Run #1 (Healthcare) + #2 (Tech)
- Pick 5-10 new ideas
- Backtest 1-2 on TradingView

**Monthly (30 minutes):**
- Run #5 (Momentum Scan)
- Update your "proven winners" list
- Remove any broken trends

**Quarterly (1 hour):**
- Re-validate sector performance
- Is Healthcare still winning? (should be)
- Are Utilities still losing? (definitely)

## 🎓 REMEMBER

**Your edge is NOT the screener.**  
**Your edge is the 293 backtests you've already done.**

FINVIZ finds candidates.  
YOU pick winners.

Use these screeners to:
1. Find stocks similar to your winners (UNH, MSFT)
2. Confirm they're still trending (SMA200)
3. Verify options liquidity
4. Deploy your proven strategies (Alt43, Alt46, Alt10)

**That's it. Don't overthink it.**
